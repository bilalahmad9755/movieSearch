# Usecase
A reactJs application has following features:
1- Fetching data from TMDB_REST_API and displaying movies on screen along with name, titleimg and release_date...
2- User can search movies by unique ID
3- User can move to next/ previous page along with results
4- User can filter data by release_date, recent_releases, popularity and reviews

# Technical Terms
1- Used axios to for API requests
2- MaterialUI for better User EXperience
3- App Components are Functional based components with useEffect, usestate implementation
4- Parent and Child components exchnaging data & callbacks using props

# Components Used
There are 4 components
1- Interface (Parent)
2- Movie(Child)
3- Pages(Child)
4- SortBy(Child)
# Components Workflow
1- Interface is responsible for initial rendering and fetching data from API, It also implements the searchBar for ID search.
2- Movie is responsible for data display using props along with image URl generation for title images
3- Pages is responsible for checking if we can move next or previous page
4- SortBy is responsible for getting input from user and fetch data accordingly using query_params
# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
